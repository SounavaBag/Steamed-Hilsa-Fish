Mustard Hilsa Fish is an iconic dish for all the Bengalis. If you are a tourist to West Bengal, you have to taste this dish, otherwise you will have to feel sad and regret to miss something big,  as this experience will not come everytime . And as a Bengali, this dish is my most favorite ever. So be ready. And yes, BEWARE OF THORNS!!!!!!!!!

So I describe all the techniques of making this dish, in steps:

Step 1: Marinate the Hilsa fish pieces with salt and turmuric for 10 mins

Step 2: Take a bowl, pour all the ingredients and mix it well.

Step 1: Take a steel tiffin box, pour that spice mixture in it and dip the fish into it.

Step 1:Take a pressure cooker, pour some water and keep the tiffin box in that pressure cooker and close 
        it

Step 1: Now put the pressure cooker on the gas oven and wait until 4 whistles

Step 1: And lastly, after 4 whistles, safely take out the tiffin box, open and serve it on a dish.

Now your dish is ready. enjoy the Bengali flavour and essence of this marvelous dish. i hope you'll like it.
